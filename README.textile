This little PHP scripts updates your addons installed from the wowace and curseforge websites.

It requires PHP5 >= 5.2 and the following extension: SimpleXML, cURL and ZIP.

(On debian-based linuxes, the packages php5-cli and php5-curl should be enough).

h2. Global configuration

The global configuration is at the start of the script.

h3. Installation path

$baseDir should point to the "AddOns" directory.

h3. Backup path

$backupDir points to the directory where backup will be saved. By default this is "$baseDir/.backup". Old versions of the addons will be moved there. There is no pruning at this moment. All directories belonging to the same addon will be moved into a directory name "project-version".

h3. Default kind of installation

$defaultKind should be either "release", "beta" or "alpha". This used to selected the kind of release you want to install.

h2. Per-addon configuration

The script will ignore any addon directory containing one of these file or directory :

* .git
* .svn
* .freeze

You can override the default kind of installation by creating an empty file named either ".release", ".beta" or ".alpha" in the addon directory.
